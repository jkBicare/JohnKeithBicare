                    <p>In designing UI/UX, I start by understanding the users’ needs and the goals of the system to ensure the interface is both functional and user-friendly. I use Figma as my main design tool because it supports real-time collaboration, responsive design, and quick prototyping. My design approach focuses on clarity, consistency, and making sure the user journey feels smooth and intuitive across all screens. I pay close attention to layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy to make interactions simple and engaging. Regular feedback is a key part of my process, helping me improve and adjust the design based on user and team input. This ensures the final product meets both user expectations and project requirements.</p>

                    <p>In website development, I have developed a solid mastery of HTML and CSS, which serve as the foundation for building clean and well-structured layouts. My experience includes using both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, giving me flexibility in meeting various design and performance requirements. I know how to bridge the two frameworks effectively, depending on the needs of the project. I also incorporate JavaScript to bring interactivity and functionality, improving the overall user experience. With these tools, I aim to deliver modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly websites.</p>

                    <p>In mobile application development, I have solid experience working with both .NET MAUI and Flutter, allowing me to build cross-platform apps efficiently. I use MAUI for its seamless integration with C# and the .NET ecosystem, which is ideal for enterprise-level and native-like applications. On the other hand, I use Flutter when the project calls for highly customized UI and fast development cycles. My workflow includes planning user flows, creating clean and responsive interfaces, and ensuring smooth performance across devices. I focus on delivering apps that are both visually appealing and easy to use. With my experience in these frameworks, I can adapt to different project needs and deliver high-quality mobile solutions.</p>

These tools have helped me create interactive and engaging games with responsive designs and smooth gameplay. Currently, I am focused on learning and mastering Unity to expand my skills in game development and take on more complex projects. Unity’s powerful engine and versatility open up new possibilities for creating immersive gaming experiences. I enjoy combining my knowledge of different platforms to build games that are fun and accessible. My goal is to continue improving and eventually develop high-quality games for a wider audience.</p>

My work includes UI layouts, character art, and other creative pieces that blend style with purpose. While my current experience is with these tools, I’m eager to expand my skills by learning more advanced digital art software to bring even more depth and versatility to my work. I’m passionate about combining creativity and design to produce visuals that capture attention and tell a story. Every piece I make is crafted with attention to detail, ensuring it both looks appealing and serves its intended function. My goal is to grow as a digital artist and create works that inspire and leave a lasting impression.</p>
